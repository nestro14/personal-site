  <p id="p-format">Ever since the accident Mrs. Emoji have had a hard time going to public places and having their inner critics get the best of them. They feared they were being ridiculed in public and laughed at because of what they looked like. With much help from friends and family they are now learning to enjoy being who they are in public. They are just now starting to eat out at restaurants, grocery stores, and going on hikes which has been much like an adventure to them.</p>
