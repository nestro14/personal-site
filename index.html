    <p>Mrs. Emoji are a fun and interesting pair that whose faces were drastically altered after a <strong><em>freak accident</em></strong> &#128561; &#128565;  that happened in pharmaceutical lab while experimenting with a drug that would allow people to control any micro expression at will. After many years of physical and emotional therapy, they learned to live with their freakishly cool now highly animated faces. This site is a testament that they are now ready to face society, to try to live a normal life and face their inner critics. Mrs. Emoji have invited you to a close up look into their lives and an opportunity to be different while still enjoying the awesome experience of <em>life</em>! </p>
